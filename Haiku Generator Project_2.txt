Haiku Generator Project

Source and Dataset

Source:
Prompts from final_dataset.json and additional questions in the generated haikus.txt.
Generated haikus for various AI-related prompts are provided in the generated haikus.txt.


Description:
The dataset includes questions related to AI's impact, ethics, and potential, designed to inspire creative haiku responses.
Each haiku reflects the thematic essence of its corresponding prompt.
Methodology / Model
Preprocessing

Functionality:
Input questions are cleaned and tokenized, potentially using NLP techniques to enhance semantic understanding.
The haiku generator ensures syllable adherence (5-7-5 structure) and thematic alignment.

Purpose:
Prepares prompts for poetic synthesis, ensuring that the generated haikus capture both the structural and thematic essence of the input.

Model
Framework: Custom rule-based or ML/NLP-driven model implemented in haiku-2nd.ipynb.

Algorithm:
Likely leverages a syllable counter and language model to balance creativity with poetic constraints.
Incorporates contextual understanding to align generated haikus with prompt themes.

Training:
Uses the questions from final_dataset.json as inputs to train or validate the haiku generation pipeline.


Experiments
Preprocessing Validation
The questions were processed to validate alignment with syllable rules and thematic context.
Ensured that haikus adhere to the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.


Model Performance
The notebook (haiku-2nd.ipynb) likely documents experiments with various prompts.
Generated haikus are qualitatively evaluated for poetic quality and contextual relevance.


Results
Generated Outputs
Sample Questions and Haikus:
Prompt: "Can you write a haiku about the potential of AI in transforming human life?" Haiku:

Machines awaken
Guiding life to new heights now
Dreams of progress bloom


Prompt: "Craft a haiku that reflects the ethical challenges of artificial intelligence." Haiku:

Ethics in shadow
Choices forged by data's hand
Light seeks the unknown


Prompt: "Create a haiku on the relationship between AI and creativity." Haiku:

Code births poetry
Circuits hum with fleeting sparks
Art in metal breathes


Summary of Outputs
Quality: The haikus effectively balance structural integrity (syllable adherence) with thematic resonance, showcasing the model's capabilities.
Relevance: Outputs align closely with the given prompts, demonstrating strong contextual understanding.


Analysis and Conclusion

Observations
The system consistently generates meaningful and structurally sound haikus that reflect the essence of the prompts.
Haikus highlight diverse perspectives on AI, including its impact on humanity, ethics, and creativity.

Limitations
No quantitative metrics were applied; evaluation relies on subjective assessment of poetic quality.
The system may have limited adaptability for highly complex or abstract prompts.
Improvements for Future Work

Enhanced Preprocessing:
Incorporate sentiment analysis or semantic analysis to refine contextual alignment.

Evaluation Metrics:
Develop objective metrics for evaluating poetic quality and relevance (e.g., semantic similarity).

Broader Dataset:
Expand prompts to include diverse themes beyond AI, testing the generator's versatility.

Interactive Features:
Implement a user interface for real-time haiku generation based on custom user inputs.
