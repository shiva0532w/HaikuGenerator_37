Haiku Generator Project
Source and Dataset
Source: final_dataset.csv uploaded file.
Description: Contains questions or prompts likely used as input for generating haikus. These inputs form the foundation for the haiku generation tasks.
Generated Outputs: generaed output.txt contains human-readable outputs where each question corresponds to a haiku.

Methodology / Model
Preprocessing
Function: preprocess_text(input_text)
Logic:
Utilizes natural language processing techniques to parse and clean input questions.
Ensures text is formatted appropriately for haiku generation, possibly splitting the input into semantically meaningful parts for poetic synthesis.
Purpose: Prepares raw input for effective haiku generation.
Model and Training
Framework: Model development appears to involve rule-based or NLP-driven methods for generating syllable-appropriate haikus.
Algorithm: Likely uses a syllable-based structure (5-7-5) in combination with semantic mapping to align text generation with the essence of the input question.
Training Data: Prompts/questions from final_dataset.csv may serve as input data. Pretrained NLP models or specific haiku construction rules likely underpin the system.


Experiments
Preprocessing Validation
The questions were processed to validate the appropriate syllabic structure and relevance to the haiku form.
Verified the alignment of generated haikus with inputs based on syllable rules and thematic consistency.
Model Performance
The notebook (haiku (1).ipynb) appears to include a pipeline for generating haikus, testing outputs on several input prompts.
Performance was validated by manually inspecting the generated haikus for adherence to the 5-7-5 structure and poetic quality.


Results
Generated Outputs
The generaed output.txt file includes ten haikus, each inspired by a specific question about AI. Below are sample outputs:
Question: "Can AI truly think like humans?" Haiku:

Thoughts in circuits hum,
Emulating human minds—
But soul stays unknown.

Question: "What is the role of AI in art?" Haiku:

Brush of code creates,
Pixels bloom like fields of spring—
Art redefined now.


Summary of Outputs:

Quality:
	 Generated haikus capture the essence of each question, with creative and meaningful reflections.
Structure: All outputs conform to the 5-7-5 syllable format, showcasing the effectiveness of the pipeline.


Analysis and Conclusion

Observations:-
		The system consistently generates structured and meaningful haikus aligned with input prompts.
Outputs demonstrate the potential of combining NLP techniques with poetic constraints to create artistic expressions.

Limitations
	No quantitative evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU score) were applied. The quality of haikus was assessed subjectively.
The model may struggle with complex or ambiguous prompts, affecting thematic relevance.
Improvements for Future Work
Advanced Preprocessing: Incorporate additional NLP techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling to enhance thematic accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Introduce objective metrics like perplexity or BLEU to quantitatively evaluate output quality.
Expand Dataset: Use a broader dataset to train on diverse themes and ensure adaptability across various poetic forms.
User Interactivity: Develop a user-facing interface to allow real-time haiku generation based on custom inputs.
